            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I'm a web and software developer currently pursuing a Master of Science in Software Development at Boston
                University Metropolitan College. As of November 2021, I am two courses away from graduation. I began my
                programming journey by taking a web development bootcamp back in 2019, so it's almost poetic to end
                these 2 years of nonstop learning by taking a course to refresh my memory and to catch up on new
                developments in the web dev world! I am building this website for CS 601 at BU - this is where I will
                log all my projects that I've made for my BU courses so far, and I hope to keep updating it during the
                next 5 weeks in the course. You can find a history of the site style <a href="sitevers.html">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>This academic year I began working as a high school computer science teacher at a charter school,
                teaching an Intro to CS course as well as AP Computer Science A. I never considered being a teacher in
                any point in my life before beginning this job - in fact, I actually had a strong aversion to a career
                in academia on any level. The pandemic put me in a stressful position financially and I applied to this
                job as a "why not" out of desperation. Taking the job was initially about convenience - a way for me to
                save up for a year so I could get some relief from being so broke. However, the more time I spend at
                this job and the more I get to know my students, the more I begin to love my job and see the appeal and
                reward people who always wanted to be educators experience. As a generally apathetic person, it's an
                interesting experience for me and I'm curious to see where it leads. </p>
