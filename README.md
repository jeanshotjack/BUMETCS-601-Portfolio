# BUMETCS-601-Portfolio
This is the beginning stages of a personal portfolio that I am building for CS601 at Boston University Metropolitan College. Created by Jean Shalenkova, Nov. 2021

## Week 1 - 11-08
This week I created the base for the website with HTML-only. I was very frustrated by the no-CSS restriction in the assignment, wanting to already position out my elements how I liked. 

## Week 2 - 11-15
This week I was able to add CSS and style how I wanted. I decided on an all-reds color scheme, with an airy pink background and different shades of red, tomato, and salmon for accents and typography. The monochrome creates a calming and uniform atmosphere while still grabbing the user's attention, but without feeling loud. 

I've aligned most of my elements using flexbox to maximize the amount of content on the screen, displayed in invisible columns, while minimizing scrolling. Using flexbox also sorted out the problem I had last week with the sections of my "personal" page - the one where I wax poetic about my cats - where the sections used to sit on top of each other. I was able to position them so images are displayed on opposite ends of each other for every other column to break up the paragraphs of straight text.  

This week's restriction was to not use responsive design, which I absolutely hated doing. I think it would be so much cleaner and fluid to just set percentages for element sizes, so they can resize uniformly, and flex-wrap a container containing containers of articles, so that when the flex row wraps, the relevant content stays together but it stacks in order.
